## Objective: 
Explanable AI plugin to ensure that ML models make decisions for the right reasons for binary classification problem

##  Code Environment Setup: 
Create python36 code env with all dependicies of running DSS Visual recipe mL model. Take reference of already created code environemnt " Plugin_model_py36"

## Pre-requisite:
The plugin run only on python36,so change runtime environment to Python 36 while runnning ML model

## Dependencies: 
Shap library version 0.32 needs to be installed.


## Inputs: 
The training dataset and url to trained ml model.

## Output: 
A list of the most important features with labeled directionalities
